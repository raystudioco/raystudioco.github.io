Welcome to my site, I've skipping blog for quite some time. I've been wanted to blog, but gave myself many execuse, finding a perfect blogging platform is one of them.

<p>
So do I have a perfect one now? No. But I realize I might go on finding, and forget the reason why I need one. After all, post and content blogged is much more important.</p>
