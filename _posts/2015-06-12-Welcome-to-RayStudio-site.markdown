<p>
Welcome to my site, I've been skipping blog for quite some time. I've been wanted to blog, but gave myself many execuses, finding a perfect blogging platform is one of them.
</p>
<p>
So do I have a perfect one now? No. But I realize I might go on finding, and forget the reason why I need one. After all, posts and content blogged are much more important.</p>
<p>
The content of the site will be about photography, coffee, travel, and few other random things, hope you will like it~
